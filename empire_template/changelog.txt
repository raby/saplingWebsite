Changelog:

v 1.1 - 21 October 2015
-------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Fixed video background issue when a grey bar would pop up under the video in certain browsers when stretched beyond 16/9 ratio
 - Added Google Maps setup in documentation


If you have already purchased the template all you have to do is:

1. replace the video script section in script.js with the new one
2. replace the old video section in style.css with the new section, this way you will not have to restyle everything.
3. replace the video background header in index.html in the video_index folder with the new header.

Just copy and paste everything, if in doubt please, let us know.
